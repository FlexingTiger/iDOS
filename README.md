## iDOS 

A custom fork of an older version of iDOS, a DOSBox emulator for iOS.

This compiles under Xcode 7 and runs under iOS 9. It was also converted to use ARC for the frontend.

### Added features include:

- mfi Controller Support, with support for remapping keyboard controls

### Features that probably aren't working:

- Hardware keyboard support (requires calling private headers and was disabled)

(I tried to add my enhancements to the above repo but there's a crash issue I can't resolve)
